2,technologyisnatural,1661115203.0,"r/climatechange is a community centered around science and technology related to climate change. As such, it can be often be beneficial to distinguish educated/informed opinions from general comments, and verified user flairs are an easy way to accomplish this. 

# Do I qualify for a user flair?

As is the case in almost any science related field, a college degree (or current pursuit of one) is required to obtain a flair. Users in the community can apply for a flair by emailing [**redditclimatechangeflair@gmail.com**](mailto:redditclimatechangeflair@gmail.com) with information that corroborates the verification claim.

**The email must include:**

1. At least one of the following: A verifiable .edu/.gov/etc email address, a picture of a diploma or business card, a screenshot of course registration, or other verifiable information.
2. The reddit username stated in the email or shown in the photograph.
3. The desired flair: **Degree Level/Occupation | Degree Area | Additional Info**  (see below)

# What will the user flair say?

In the verification email, please specify the desired flair information. A flair has the following form:

>USERNAME    **Degree Level/Occupation | Degree area | Additional Info**

For example if reddit user “Jane” has a PhD in Atmospheric Science with a specialty in climate modeling, Jane can request:

>Flair text: PhD | Atmospheric Science | Climate Modeling

If “John” works as an electrical engineer designing wind turbines, he could request:

>Flair text: Electrical Engineer | Wind Turbines

Other examples:

>Flair Text: PhD | Marine Science | Marine Microbiology
>  
>Flair Text: Grad Student | Geophysics | Permafrost Dynamics
>  
>Flair Text: Undergrad | Physics  
>  
>Flair Text: BS | Computer Science | Risk Estimates

Note: The information used to verify the flair claim does not have to corroborate the specific additional information, but rather the broad degree area. (i.e. “John” above would only have to show he is an electrical engineer, but not that he works specifically on wind turbines).

# A note on information security

While it is encouraged that the verification email includes no sensitive information, we recognize that this may not be easy or possible for each situation. Therefore, the verification email is only accessible by a limited number of moderators, and emails are deleted after verification is completed. If you have any information security concerns, please feel free to reach out to the mod team or refrain from the verification program entirely.

# A note on the conduct of verified users

Flaired users will be held to higher standards of conduct. This includes both the technical information  provided to the community, as well as the general conduct when interacting with other users. The moderation team does hold the right to remove flairs at any time for any circumstance, especially if the user does not adhere to the professionalism and courtesy expected of flaired users. Even if qualified, you are not entitled to a user flair.

# Thanks

Thanks to r/fusion for providing the model of this Verified User Flair Program, and to u/AsHotAsTheClimate for suggesting it.",27,0,climatechange
3,tenatore,1700105524.0,"Hi everyone!

I've been seeing a lot of pretty messed up news the last few years around global warming.  
Most recently, carbon bombs got me down ( [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2022/may/11/fossil-fuel-carbon-bombs-climate-breakdown-oil-gas](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2022/may/11/fossil-fuel-carbon-bombs-climate-breakdown-oil-gas) ) but honestly now, it looks like just another one of those things that's driving humanity straight into a wall (just look at most of the other posts in this subreddit..).

It seems like the ones responsible for this stuff are always the same usual suspects: (ExxonMobil, Shell etc. to name just a few). There are others sure but most boils down to a couple of companies.

On the news, we're starting to see more and more pretty insane impacts related to global warming at a very large scale. Population displacements, people running out of water, food etc.

It seems that the deliberate actions of individuals (fully knowing they're accelerating global warming) for profit are impacting millions across the globe and that to me just sounds evil.

 I guess it's hard to quantify the impact but in the [1998 Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court](https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library/Documents/RS-Eng.pdf) there is a clause that mentions crimes against humanity include: ""Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health"".  I guess the International criminal court focuses more on war crimes , nevertheless the definition doesn't seem limited to it. It's now safe to argue that global warming is causing great suffering and some groups seem to be doing it intentionally so why doesn't it qualify?

Now I don't know a single thing about law/international law but I'm honestly surprised that some of these large groups have never had complaints filed against them or gone to trial in an international court (at least that I know of). I've heard of a couple of cases at a national scale but never of something international (which is the scale at which they're operating) and I've always wondered ""Why?""

Is there anyone on this subreddit that knows enough about international law here to shed some light as to why that's never happened before (and probably won't ever happen)?",103,0,climatechange

It would use a lot of energy to pyrolyse wood on such a large scale but if in the future we switch to mostly renewable energy could this permanently remove CO2 from the carbon cycle?

Im not saying this is a current solution because we still rely too much on fossil fuels but even if we switch to renewable energy sources or nuclear we would still need to remove the CO2 we put in the atmosphere so would this be a viable method for that?

The Ozone Hole (OH) didn't used to be a climate issue until the U.N. rolled it into Climate Change (CC), using that pretext to explain why they were wrong.  In 2019, they patted themselves on the back after the OH was much smaller than most years since measurements began \~1980, claiming the Montreal Protocol which eliminated most CFC's had finally shown results.  But, the following years had higher than ever OH extent, so they pivoted to blaming changes in the Polar Vortex, due to CC.  Warmer, more humid air flowed to Antarctica, which caused the Stratosphere to cool, to produce more ice crystals which decrease ozone during the Antarctic Winter.  Strangely, the average air temperature at the ground did not increase, despite this supposed warmer air flow.

If you followed above, you are ready for this latest article.  As I read it, being 16th largest (edit) is good since the years since 2020-2022 were close to the largest.  This despite the Tonga volcano putting more water vapor into the air which they claim would have increased ozone-depletion (not explained, ice crystals?).  What can be agreed on is that much fewer CFC's are now measured in the Antarctic Stratosphere (via satellite), which would be good if they truly cause ozone depletion, but the planet doesn't appear to cooperate to show such correlation.  BTW, what was the fear about anyway since the OH only exists over Antarctica, and the very tip of South America, only during the depths of Winter when there is minimal sunlight?",0,0,climatechange

As temperatures rise, the amount of heat trapped by cities must also go up, and be retained longer. So I'm wondering if that is one of reasons the models are off in relation to the rate of change. The numbers of cities and towns across the globe are immense, and if they are trapping and releasing heat on a daily cycle, in increasing amounts, do the models include them as feedback heat sources?

69,Consistent_Piano_210,1699629367.0,"About a month or so ago, I posted about the merits of solar and wind compared to nuclear.

While I asserted that wind and solar are generally better than nuclear, I conceded that nuclear is better than batteries (in conjunction with wind and solar) in terms of ""capacity"" and reliability.  Specifically, for example, solar with tracking (and batteries) is generally estimated to produce 5x the wattage of nuclear (see source below).

[https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/assumptions/pdf/table\_8.2.pdf](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/assumptions/pdf/table_8.2.pdf)

I noted that Nickel Iron (NiFe) battery technology is superior to what is currently being used, which is Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePh), or other forms of Lithium battery technology, in that it is a higher return on investment, lasts much longer, can be easily repaired, is recyclable, and does very very little damage to the environment (basically negligible in the frame of reference of general battery technology).  The noteworthy downsides of NiFe are that it requires water to be added every few months, but this can be easily automated, and that the initial cost is high, but this would be negated entirely upon mass production (since the design is far simpler), and when comparing to a nuclear grid system they are likely to be cheaper, but it depends on the situation.

Credible sources consistently state that nuclear energy is of roughly equal environmental damage to solar and wind using Lithium batteries.  If Nickel Iron batteries are utilized, wind and solar would therefore be cleaner than nuclear.  Rooftop solar is also under-utilized to an extreme and should be absolutely subsidized as rooftop solar has no footprint (takes no land to use).

In the discussion on that prior post, something was brought to my attention, which in hindsight and when trying to summarize it now in introducing the issue, seems simple, but I think the issue is more complex than it at first will appear.  Obviously, solar and wind aren't reliable.  Batteries need to be used to store energy for downtimes.  Now lets say we get no wind and lots of clouds for some variable number of consecutive days.

Thus we can write a formula to tell us at what point the cost of batteries to account for solar and wind downtime will equal the cost to build a nuclear plant.  We can look at historical anomalies of having no wind and lots of clouds for consecutive days.

""Grid transfer"" (something I don't know much about) can also be used.

Some questions come to mind.

Namely would it be practical to use nuclear to provide a baseload of minimum required electricity during known downtimes (specifically the night, but also accounting to some degree for batteries and wind)?  This would depend on the answer to whether it is of roughly same cost to build a ""small"" nuclear plant to supply a minimum baseload of electricity at night as it would be to build a larger nuclear facility to power the entire needs of the grid.

Again, solar with tracking and batteries produce 5x the wattage per dollar invested compared to nuclear.  Fossil fuels need to be replaced as soon as possible - we are all in agreement on that.  It is prudent to be cognizant of how resources are spent, to the degree that is practical.

I believe it should not be difficult to compare the cost of nuclear to the cost of batteries needed for downtimes, and make the best decision.

Again, fossil fuels need to be replaced as soon as possible.  I see absolutely no excuse for not replacing FF for production of grid energy.

Edit:

Let me try to restate the issue again.

The issue is that some people have argued that because solar and wind are inherently unreliable, and nuclear is inherently reliable, and because we would need enough nuclear to power the grid during solar and wind downtime anyway, we might as well go all in on nuclear.  This is somewhat oversimplified, because it does not include batteries.  With batteries, you can go without solar or wind for as long as you have watt-hours in the batteries.

This post is intended to be about the issue in the above paragraph.

My question is what the difference in cost would be between building a nuclear facility that can produce the minimum needs during downtime of solar (i.e. at night) and wind, and the cost to build a nuclear facility that can power the grid during the times when there is the highest need.

We have to determine which of the two options is better:

1. Build a small nuclear plant to power the grid at night, and then use solar and wind and batteries to make up the difference.
2. Go all in on nuclear.

I tried to provide a general guide in the post on how to answer that, as it depends, obviously, on the weather of the place where the facilities are being constructed.  If you only have 10 cloudy days a year, then you only need enough batteries to compensate for that.  If you regularly get 100 consecutive cloudy days a year, then you can calculate how much batteries you would need and compare it to the cost of nuclear.  If you regularly get constant winds when it's cloudy, then you can factor that in as well.",1,0,climatechange

Otherwise, what is your point? That floods did not occur before we released CO2 in the atmosphere? 

If you want to discuss the unusually cold summer in your Norwegian home town (typical for the r/climateskeptics sub), what is your point? Global warming is not defined by a small specific location. Anomalies are found everywhere, all the time, because the world is large and complex and full of variability. 

Consider the empirical data at the global scale. Splitting it into different regions is fine, but don't lose sight of the larger trends. Considering hurricane trends for the North Atlantic is fine but what about the other regions and what about the global total? We tend to zoom in on certain events or regions that catches our attention and lose sight of the bigger picture. ",92,0,climatechange

76,LastTopQuark,1699530833.0,"Looking for a contact that would have knowledge of various seas, and how electromagnetic and acoustic waves affect life within an ocean environment at various depths. The legacy product that we are replacing uses a 12KHz carrier for transmission, I would like to avoid using that due to the audio range. What I would like to use is spread spectrum/frequency hopping in a higher range, say 100-200kHz, but overall will try to avoid that with buoyed connections from the mesh to a link on the surface with SDA OCT. Also looking for feedback on what would be presently useful, and for future what would be 'cool' to see work. Legacy system samples about 20 different sensors at a 0.3-3Hz rate. I'd like to replace this with a less impactful system (no impact hopefully) and then repurpose another video product we have which can process GB of data. As an example of cool, I'd like to see video 'zones' where a cube of water can be visually monitored in real time at 8K, and send it to our AR system. Are there any researchers on here that can comment or contact me about what they would do with a low cost/highly effective system? With the next version I'd like to make sure we meet at least ten researcher's needs. Thanks!",2,0,climatechange

I am a student at Grand Valley State University in Michigan, USA. I am doing a project on natural disasters and relief aid in Tonga. I would like to reach out to those living in Tonga and/or experts on climate change and natural disaster. I am having a hard time finding people and connecting with them.

The table shows that the Global region warming trend of +0.22ºC per decade during the 30-year period, 1994-2023, was 7.3 times the Global region warming trend of +0.03ºC per decade during the earlier 143-year period, 1851-1994.   
              
***     
      
The NOAA climate record for the user-selectable Global, Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere, Arctic, and Antarctic regions, and any user-selectable Latitude-Longitude location, extends from 1 Jan 1850 to 30 Sep 2023, which currently is the most recent full month in the dataset, but typically is updated around the middle of each month with climate data for the most recent full month (e.g., Oct 1-31, 2023).   
                        
The NOAA Global Time Series time scale at the bottom of the chart indicates that climate data for the other user-selectable named regions extends from 1 Jan 1910 to 30 Sep 2023.        
                  
***              
           
In this example, in the NOAA Global Time Series interface, the user-selected settings (Time Scale: 12-month and Month: September) capture the NOAA climate record for each 12-month period ending in September (Oct 1–Sep 30, 1850-2023). With those user settings, the time scale at the bottom of the graph does not display 1850 or 1910 as the starting year. Instead, the time scale displays the beginning year as 1851 or 1911 because the user settings for Time Scale: 12-Month and Month: September begin on Oct 1 and end on Sep 30 (e.g. 1 Oct 1850 – 30 Sep 1851, and 1 Oct 1910 – 30 Sep 1911).",20,0,climatechange

Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) specifically details the North Korean regime’s gross human rights violations against its own citizens. However, the roles played by authoritarian leaders in Beijing and Moscow in facilitating North Korea’s human rights violations are less frequently examined.

This report by Victor Cha and Katrin Fraser Katz examines China and Russia’s roles in perpetuating North Korea’s human rights abuses and explores how recent global developments including the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have presented North Korea with new incentives and opportunities for repression.

It's not so new. At some points in my childhood, I've had the thought that I didn't want to be a man, but I just dismissed it, thinking everyone has those kind of thoughts from time to time and that they don't mean anything. Today I'm not so sure. I also dismissed them because of my body. I am large and have muscles, so I've always felt my body would prevent me from ever transitioning if I ever felt like it.

307,Individual-Edge4491,1699751086.0,"I am biologically female (23). I have been questioning my gender for years, and I remember wishing I was the opposite gender since elementary school. I have been to therapy and have discussed the possibility of being transgender with my therapist. First, when I was 18, I finally got the courage to discuss this with a therapist and bring my mom into the discussion. I was dressing in masculine clothing at that time, and my therapist suggested that when I go off to college, I try a masculine name and pronouns. I started to feel overwhelmed and sort of shut down, dismissing the subject completely. 

For three years of college, I went by without even thinking about questioning my gender. I don’t think the feelings came up again, until one of my guy friends asked me out. We got along well and on paper I could see us as a couple, but I couldn’t get past the idea of how uncomfortable I was at the thought of him touching me in any romantic or sexual way, which sounds like I’m asexual.

But a part of me wonders if my gender identity is tied to these repulsions towards sex. When I was younger, before I knew how sex worked, I used to pinch my stomach in the shower every night because I was afraid of getting pregnant. And to this day, I won’t touch my chest because it makes me uncomfortable. (Luckily, I am flat-chested.)

This year I brought up with my mom and the newer therapist I have been seeing that I have been questioning my gender identity again. I do not get dysphoric about clothes or mannerisms. I have grown to like wearing what is labeled as feminine clothing, and I feel like people are nicer to me when I dress feminine. I used to hate feminine clothing as a kid though. I did give wearing masculine clothing a shot one more time this year, but I felt insecure, like I was being judged. I honestly felt like a clown. I don’t fixate over names or pronouns because I don’t talk to a lot of people and even avoid calling people by their names anyways. Personally, I feel zero attachment to my own name and don’t think it’s something I value. I told her it basically came down to body parts. I wish I had a male body and that’s really all there is to it. I don’t feel like I could have a relationship with a partner without one. My desire is to be seen as male by my romantic partner. Obviously, I can’t know what it is like to have a male body, but I have a strong desire for the bottom and top ftm surgeries.

Some of my doubts that these feeling are valid are:
-I could be experiencing obsessive thoughts over gender identity. Similar to transgender OCD, with a fear that if I don’t change my identity I will die alone.
-I am asexual and will be a virgin forever and need to learn to accept that.
-Is it possible that wishing to be male is different from those who identify with and really have masculine identities?

Maybe there are other people who can relate to this? Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks.",1,0,gender

309,IntelligentMight7297,1699493129.0,"This is potentially not the perfect place to post this but I’m trying to understand myself and also be able to explain it, and I think this community might get it the best. 

I identify as she/her/they, I’m 28 and I also identify as pansexual. I graduated high school in 2012- so era of just getting out of people saying “that’s gay” and it being socially accepted in younger people to explore sexuality and gender more. I quite honestly have just not really thought about myself in these lights super complexly. I thought I was bisexual for a long time, then realized I was what would be called pan. Either way I’m a late bloomer in this- I don’t think I fully understood i was pan until around 26. I didn’t come out, I didn’t feel the need to, the people I loved loved me for me and nothing about who I was partnered or sleeping with would have changed that and I’ve never had anxieties about it. 

My gender has also been along the same journey. I’ve never felt like one of the girls, not one of the boys. I just am. I didn’t even realize the need or desire to look into this until I started understanding my sexuality more. I use she/her/they cause it feels the most appropriate. I identify with being female because of how I was socialized due to my sex, I do feel enough femininity to primarily identify as she/her, but enough of me is uncomfortable with that that I relate to non-binary expression of they/them as well. I’ve played with androgynous clothing and whatnot over the years, I’m comfortable in most anything, so I wear what feels good for the day at hand. Sometimes it’s makes up, sometimes it a dress, sometimes it’s none of that. Sometimes have long hair, sometimes short. Nothing about it is definitive which I enjoy. Again- the people I live in my life just love me and don’t care about this stuff. Never felt any need to come out or anything. I’m just living my life. 

However, on dating apps and spaces where I am asked to provide pronouns I write she/her/they, I dont believe in being invisible even if I don’t feel the need to come out. Assumed people who didn’t like the they would weeds themselves out on dating apps. 

Turns out, sometimes they don’t even look at it or consider it. I’m in a relationship with a straight cis man, he’s what I would say is a progressive centrist, my sexuality and gender identity has not been an issue but it came up after a drunk night out that something that would prevent us from getting married was if I decided to fully identify as they/them and be out about it. Obviously I can’t predict the future and considering I already identify with they it’s not off the table. We had some big talks about it and he wants to understand my perspective better but I don’t really understand how to explain it because it’s just something I feel. 

How do you understand or identify as she/her/they? What parts of myself should I be looking at to figure this out into concrete words? How can I explain how I feel to someone completely comfortable in their biological gender and sex?",1,0,gender

I have a female body, but I never “felt” like a woman. I just don’t feel like anything but an ape who happens to be female biologically. 

I grew up in a very conservative society so I started to hate the expectations placed on women very young. I started to reject anything feminine in middle school, I felt extremely uncomfortable in skirts and dresses - mostly due to the possibility of being seen as a sexual woman by straight men. I also have always found dancing veryy uncomfortable because of the same reasoning (I guess I have a problem with intimacy in general). 

Now I’m 22 years old and I’ve grown to appreciate my femininity, but I see it as a performance or a tool. I know that if I put on some makeup and a cute outfit that I am more likely to have a good day (people will be nicer, maybe a compliment here and there, I’ll be more likely to be talked to etc.). It’s like I can turn my womanhood on and off. Also I’m mostly attracted to androgynous people, if that has any correlation.

313,reptillian_still_man,1699378387.0,"hey everyone,

I'm a 23 y/o bisexual male confused about new gender ideas and I would really appreciate your thoughts on the matter.

If you're non-binary, what about yourself makes you identify as such? I've tried to educate myself over the past few years and am still so damn confused. It seems like with the definitions I hear, everyone in the world would be non-binary, since it's rare to have someone fully embody all of the male or female standards. 

And I also thought the idea of discrediting gender norms/standards was a part of this movement, and I always appreciated that. However, I often hear gender norms cited when people describe their non-binaryness. 

Take myself for example, my pronouns are he/him. I don't view myself as 100% masculine or 100% feminine. I'm somewhere in between, like nearly everyone else I know. And I don't like gendering the things I'm into.  I like to paint my nails sometimes, I do a lot of yoga, watch reality tv, bike, hang with friends, like politics, and most of my time is spend studying, as I'm an engineering student and my classes are more demanding than I'd prefer. I like traditionally feminine things, and I like traditionally masculine things. I like shooting guns and lifting weights, I also like cooking, cleaning, and, of course, lots of other shit, as we are all complicated individuals with lots of interests. Again, I prefer not to gender the things I'm into. Whether it's painting nails or guns, I take those things at face value and see no utility in involving gender. I have a lot of queer friends and am technically queer myself but to be frank I often present as straight, I'm told. Even though I dont think my preferred style/clothing is anything close to an indicator of my sexual preferences. Most of my time and attention is towards school/work/health and I haven't made much progress on my understanding of new gender ideas. 

I just don't get it. Any thoughts or helpful links would be appreciated. What does being non-binary mean to you?

I've been getting a lot of gender envy from trans women. I'm not a woman, I don't have any connection to any gender, but I feel like I'd been happier if I was a trans woman, or transfem? I'm afraid to talk about it, I feel like this is offensive. I'm really just confused. I have a lot of dysphoria and am really miserable, because I'll never be a trans woman. I don't feel good at all when I am seen as a cis woman, it makes me extremely dysphoric, but thinking about being seen as a trans woman makes me very euphoric.

322,RandomVentAccount13,1698326516.0,"(Disclaimer: Writing this a bit early in the morning. Apologies in advance if some aspects of this post are written poorly.)   


Hello, I guess I should start by saying that I am afab and have gone by any pronouns for the past couple of years, now. Many people still refer to me as she/her, with some opting for they/them. I also had very few encounters online where some referred to me as he/him.  


Lately, though, I haven't felt entirely happy with being connected to womanhood. I hate that many people expect women to want babies, and also expect women to see their attributes as empowering. I don't think my boobs, uterus pouch, and period are empowering. Honestly, a lot of the time, being a woman feels like a curse physically, mentally, and socially. Although my biggest obstacle in figuring myself out is my thought process. Do I hate being a woman simply because I don't fit the standards of one? Is my mindset towards being a woman just too negative? Or would I feel more myself if I identified as a different gender? I don't know if these questions in my mind come from some form of imposter syndrome, or if maybe others have thought the same way before discovering themselves.   


When I look in the mirror sometimes, the person I see looking back at me just doesn't feel like myself. Not really in an ""I'm so ugly"" way (though I won't deny I feel ugly at times), but kind of like I'm not quite connected to myself. It's hard to explain, but the more overwhelmed I am, the stronger this feeling can be. Almost to the point that I just feel like some lost soul piloting a meat suit.  


A lot of the time, when gender is brought up, people have suggested to try different clothing styles (more masculine things). Which, isn't an awful suggestion, but it's not something I can really afford to do. And, with a lot of time spent online, I mostly just explore different styles through in-game avatars. Sometimes I do feel feminine enough to present myself that way in a video game. Other times, I want to look masculine or androgynous. Could this mean I'm genderfluid? Well, more thoughts creep up.. A lot of guys will use feminine avatars, but that doesn't make them any less of a guy. Plus, anytime I do use a feminine avatar, it looks nothing like me, and is arguably way prettier than I could ever be in real life. So then I wonder if I just have issues with how I look.   


I guess my point here is to ask the very question that's in the title. How did you all figure out your gender identity? I ask because I want to see if I relate to any answers here.

My(33F) younger sibling(20NB) has gone through a journey of self discovery. When they were younger they thought they might be trans, but has since told me they want me to use they/them pronouns and call them by their chosen name, which I have done. 

My partner(30M) has known my younger sibling since they were 11 years old, and while he has also tried to follow my lead in changing his language to include my sibling’s preferred pronouns and name, he brings up the same topic time and time again.

He mentions that often, my younger sibling dresses in feminine clothing and wears makeup, and says he has a hard time believing that they are NB. I try to explain the best I can about the difference between one’s gender identity and one’s preferred style, but he argues back that if someone wanted to be gender neutral, they wouldn’t be wearing makeup, or dresses. He brings up that he’s never seen anything masculine about my sibling, from their clothes to their interests.

I mentioned that those views sound a lot like gendered stereotypes. Who is the authority on what is considered a feminine thing or a masculine thing? That’s not to mention the entire spectrum of other identities there are concerning gender. I hate wearing dresses. I don’t wear makeup. I don’t get my nails done. As a child, I preferred playing with blocks and cars over the tons of Barbies my mother bought me. I had a huge battle of wits with my father when I cut my hair to my shoulders because “girls and women are supposed to have long hair”. I’m not into stereotypically feminine things, does that mean he’d believe me if I told him I identify as being male? His argument just didn’t make sense to me.

Admittedly, I don’t feel informed enough about this to even get my point across. I’m hoping people on this sub can offer better insight, or places I can get more information to try and educate myself and my partner about this. It’s not like he has a bad relationship with my sibling, but he focuses on this one aspect and I just want him to understand how the clothes someone wears when they walk out of the house isn’t directly correlated to anything other than maybe they just like the way something looks. I wore men’s shoes for a time and I still shop for men’s hoodies/jackets /t-shirts because they have designs I like. It meant nothing beyond me just loving the style of something or how it fit on me.

My younger sibling is the most important person in my life and my best friend. I will always support them, accept them for who they are, and defend them. This is a discussion I want to stop having over and over. It’s bad enough that our parents have refused to accept my sibling’s identity, much less use the correct pronouns/name. I shouldn’t have to argue the validity of my sibling’s identity against society’s biased views on gender, but here we are.

I hope y’all are nice about this and not try to call out my partner or anything. Sometimes people just don’t know better or have been taught to see things a certain way by society. It doesn’t make them bad people, just misinformed ones. I want to be better about this.",2,0,gender

Hi everyone, I am 22 afab and stuggling with my gender identity. For some backround I came out to my family as lesbian at about 19 my mum was very upset and awful to me (she has never liked my more masculine presentation since i was a child). But everyone else in my life was amazing. I had some times in my teens where i would watch transgender videos on youtube and i think somewhere in my brain it resinated but i didnt think much of it then i couldnt even accept myself as gay. A few years ago i started questioning my gender more seriously basically out of no where, this stemed from watching these videos all the time and lots of reading, i denied for a while that i might want to try changing non medical aspects to see and eventually i did.

As a teenager and before i started to change my presentation i had deep deoresionalisation and did not recognise the person looking back at me which caused great destress i felt that ive always been looking for the answer i thought i was deeply depressed but didnt know why. I cut my hair short, started binding and used he him pronouns and new name  (only o friends) this went on for a while. I then felt it was too much for me and wasnt 100 on it all even thiugh i experienced a lot of euphoria and i felt better. I began using they them pronouns with friends and a shorter version of my name.

The euphoria lasted a long time from these changes and made me feek confortable and explore myself. I now have settled into it but am going back to these videos and reading loads online wandering if i want to take more steps im not sure i am fully aligned with myself, i have dysphoria aroind my hips chest voice but dress accordingly bind and maange to use my nick name in most places my mum doesnt rly click. I recognise myself now but feel that sence of not being myself still and disconnect its just less intense i have some more sence of self. I was wandering if anyone else experienced this ever or similer what helped and the out come.

All my life, I’ve had short hair, and so growing up, many people have assumed I was a boy. There were times I grew my hair out a bit, but never past my shoulders. 

When I was in 7th grade, I came across the concept of “gender-fluid,” and I really resonated with it. I started dressing between masculinity to femininity to unisex. I started wrapping my chest. I felt comfortable with myself in the mirror depending on which gender I felt more of for the day. Unfortunately, because of how I dressed, I was also made fun of a lot. I’d hear people talking behind my back, laughing about my clothes and my shoes. My family also started questioning why I was dressing like a man, and my sister would outright humiliate me for what I’d wear.

So, I gave up on myself and started dressing more feminine.

Later in high school, I started to hate my body, my curves and how big my chest was. I envied the girls with small chests and more gender neutral features. I craved to be thinner, so I started starving myself to get more of a unisex figure. In the end, I wore overly baggy clothes to hide my feminine figure and stop caring about how people viewed me.

Now, I’m in college, and I view myself as simply a “person.” I don’t see myself as a woman or a man. I feel extremely “in the middle.” I bought my first binder the other day to satiate my feelings of gender dysphoria. I feel that my pronouns now align more with “they/them” than “she/they” anymore.

My objective is to help people better understand what it means to be transgender and to correct some of the most common misconceptions that I keep seeing. 

**Full disclosure** \- I am a white, (mostly) cishet man who sees a vulnerable and marginalised group of people, under sustained attack for being who they are. I just want to be a small voice in the darkness, to help other people understand why gender and sex are not the same thing, and dispel some of the myths that others perpetuate, in order to invalidate the lived experience of gender non-conforming people.

  
Before I can do any of this, I obviously want to make sure I'm not misrepresenting the subject matter. 

As far as I can understand it, gender identity is the *totality* of the experience of being a man or being a woman. Our gender identity takes into account many different factors - including, but not limited to, or exclusively defined by, our sex. I think it makes more sense to define gender identity as a spectrum, from strongly female to strongly male.

Many gender-critical people seem to miss this important distinction, reducing each of us essentially to what is (or isn't) between our legs - characterising women as nothing more than walking wombs and men as just... well, d!cks.

Therefore, I would love to have some input from this community - what does your gender identity, as an individual, mean to you? Whether you're cis, trans, NB, or something else - what are the main characteristics that define your gender identity? 

If your experience of your gender identity is at odds with the presentation of your genitals, what are the most significant aspects of that experience, that so strongly contradict your primary sexual characteristics? 

Is my current understanding, as summarised above, accurate, or am I way off?

Please respond to this post with your own experience of your gender identity, or any other information (e.g. links to relevant research or resources) that you think might help, to ensure that any material I do produce will be more likely to help than hinder my efforts to balance the narrative.

If I have used any wording in this post that is insensitive or offensive to you, please understand that it comes from a place of ignorance and not malice - while I hope to be able to help to educate others, I accept that I am still learning and I am happy to be corrected.

i’ve always had a very feminine body. one that i developed somewhat early, which caused problems within itself. i was treated really weirdly by my peers, especially the male ones. part of it felt like it was validating my girlhood. especially since i was told this is what womanhood is. part of it made me feel like shit. if this is what being a woman is, does it mean to be a woman is to suffer? but it was fine i guess, i liked girls, i liked being a girl who liked girls. man i still like being a girl who likes girls! and i like girls who like girls. i love women. 

recently it’s been weird. i’ve realized i like being called a boy. not in a boy way, but in a neutral way. a lot of boy things feels more neutral than girl things. i like the idea of being neutral. just a person. i’ve been calling myself a man, it’s fun, to imagine myself as a big strong man. i’m having fun. i’ve been having dreams where i was born a boy, but a pretty one. one who still gets to wear dresses. it’s really really nice. part of me think i wanna be a boy. but a boy the same way link is a boy. link is pretty, he gets to wear dresses still, and everyone still calls him a boy. but i think to become him i’d have to change myself, and i don’t really want to. it's my body, and even if it used as a girls body maybe part of me still likes being a girl. a secret part, just for me. 

i don't know what i'm looking for with this post. i get this is sorta confusing? i'm confused at least. advice would be nice i guess? guidance? or just a sign that anyone feels the same. i feel really weird now. i wish i had a label or something.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for 2.5 almost 3 years now, and have been friends for 7/8 years- so we know each other really well. She hasn't always been super masculine presenting, but in the last few years she has really started to feel more comfortable dressing in non feminine clothes and seems very happy about it. 

The thing is, she has always said she wished she was just a boy bc it would be easier, or just to experience it. I kinda brushed this off as just curiosity and not genuine interest because a lot of people are just curious about what being the other gender would be like.

Recently, as in the last few months, she has been talking about it a lot. There's this beard filter on Tik Tok and she says she wishes she had a beard or could grow one, and posts about wanting to be or wishing she was a boy. She also wishes she could take testosterone just for ""big muscles, height, facial hair, face features, and having a penis"". At the same time, she said she is still kinda fine with being a girl.

Like, I don't know, but that seems like she might genuinely be questioning her gender and I just want to help and support her. I don't really label myself but I don't really like guys and she knows this, but I've told her a lot that even if she was a guy I would still date her. Which I would. I just want to help. I saw online that trying different pronouns in private could be something to try, or trying things like a binder, etc. I don't know if any of that would be helpful. Or if it would even be ok for me to bring up. Is it my place to try to help? We are each other's best friends and are already planning on spending the rest of our lives together. I just want to support her in any way possible, and whether that is staying out of it or coming up with ideas to help, I don't care, I would do whatever.

TL;DR: Need advice about how to support/guide another parent regarding gender identity issues for teens.

I need some honest advice about parenting!  Let me preface this by saying I had an internal debate for the last few days about WHERE I should post this.  I have plenty of mom groups, but I want the audience to be skewed a little younger, and not necessarily from MOMS, just people In general who may relate a little better to the younger (high school) generation.

 I am turning 40 in just a few weeks so I know I am a little more of an elder millennial compared to most of you, PLUS I grew up in the south, as a preacher's kid, so despite my teen rebellion and current liberal leanings, there are some deeply Ingrained conservative Christian values affecting me subconsciously.  Please don't take this as that I am not giving my all 100% to be loving and accepting.  I am going beyond what my brain tells me I should and sometimes am ashamed of the knee-jerk gut reactions/thoughts that come up for me.  I am de-programming...and for those of you who do not have kids, please know that as a parent, things like this come up where you can be 100% totally non-biased and accepting of other adults but when It comes to your own, for some reason It hits differently.

My child, we will call them Kayden, is turning 15 next month and a freshman In high school.  We haven't always had the closest/best relationship, but I pride myself and she has expressed gratitude for the fact that we have very open communication.  

Growing up as a Southern Baptist preacher's daughter In Texas, I was used to hiding literally EVERYTHING about my life and identity from my parents.  The best thing they ever taught me was how NOT to parent, and I haven't always been sure about what I've been doing and IF I am making the right decisions because I didn't have the best examples.  So far, I think we are doing pretty OK.  The one thing I am proud of is how open our relationship Is.  This means I hear the good and the bad.  I listen to ALL of it, because I think maintaining open communication Is literally the MOST Important thing in the teen years.  I don't shame, blame or guilt my child.  I let her know that I am not here to ""get her in trouble"" but to guide her.  This has made a world of difference.  

Because of this openness, I have heard things a lot of parents have not- don't get me wrong, I am not the permissive parent who is letting the kids come over and party, but I have started to hear things that are concerning.  I am not the ""best friend"" parent, I don't always take their side, but I try to advise them on how to handle things themselves.  I am now coming to a point In time where some of the things I'm being told are serious, and need to be taken to other adults.  I don't want to be a ""snitch"", and would not go behind my child's back and tell another adult something unless I told them first, unless someone was at risk of harm, in which case I would.

My child is trans, F2M, and most of their friends are as well.  There Is one friend In particular, let's call them Gabe, who struggles with their relationship with their mom because of this.  The kids have labeled this mom ""a bitch"", but I am not taking that at face value because I know how kids are, however I also want to heed this as somewhat of a warning to be careful of what I say because I value my relationships with the kids.  

As an example- my child went to a sleepover at their friend Jayden's house- the 3 friends were there, I did not know the parent (dad only) but I trust my child and was not concerned as they tell me everything and would text me normally If things were amiss.  They stayed up all night, as 14 year olds do at sleepovers.  They told me the next morning that they didn't sleep well, but they were the only one who slept.  I don't remember how the dad was brought up, but they told me that he actually never came home.  They told me this is a regular thing, he goes to bars and doesn't come home.  He knew the kids were staying the night and this is NOT OK in my book.  

I was pretty upset about this revelation, and kind of jumped to conclusions that they were hiding it from me.  I (sort of angrily) asked why they didn't tell me he wouldn't be there, but it turns out that he was out and told Jaden that he was planning to be home at 11 or so (perfectly fine for me to be home by 11 because of the age and my trust In my kid for them to be home alone at a friend's, but parents need to be home overnight AND would have been nice to know this in advance).  

Apparently the Dad just never came back.  I asked my kid why they did not tell me this upfront, and they told me that they did not assume It was a big deal because when they go to their Dad's house he is often out until late at night (not my favorite, but I also feel they are old enough that it isn't worth making a huge deal over it to their Dad since we have a pretty good relationship- I personally am always home by 10 if they are home alone, but no judgment here).  Anyway, I felt their reasoning made sense so let my child know that they were NOT in trouble, as they had not encountered a sitaution like this before, however this was a good opportunity to set expectations for the future when staying over at a friends'.  

After this incident, my child let me know that Gabe's mom was very strict- she met Jaden's Dad beforehand to screen him, and she really liked him and thought the sleepover was totally fine.  I had not met her but I knew based on the description of her that there was no way she'd approve of the fact that Jaden's Dad never came home.  I wrote up a text and sent It to my kid and encouraged them to share it with Gabe.  I don't know Gabe well enough to give them direct advice 1 on 1, but wanted to give them some advice, because my kid told me that they have had a tough relationship with their mom and was in the stage of ""regaining trust"".  Gabe was super upset with my kid for telling me everything, but they defended It and told them that ""my mom is cool don't worry"".  I did not feel that this was such a safety breach that I had to rat the kids out, but I wanted to strongly encourage Gabe to tell his mom if he did in fact want to build up some trust.  I told him that I would back him up, since this was not the kids' idea to be alone and more the fault of that Dad than anything.  I get being afraid and wanting to hide things regardless, but I told him that telling his mom would  most likely make her trust him more.  I was delighted to find out that he did in fact tell his mom after this, and he stopped being mad at my kid for telling me.  Parenting win.

OK- so backstory Is over- I know that was long, thank you for making It this far, I know you've yawned 19 times and had 4 cups of coffee and an adderal by now, but keep reading, you've made it this long- you are invested and I need your advice!!!!

So last week Gabe's mom texted me.  I didn't even know she had my #.  She said ""This Is Ariel's Mom""...It took me a LONG time to figure It out, and I had to ask my kid.  Gabe's ""deadname"" (ugh I don't really like that term, still, as a parent) is Ariel.  She asked me if I could meet her for coffee this week (TOMORROW!).  She said she just wants support as both of our kids are ""exploring their Identities"".  I don't feel like I am an expert on this AT ALL.  My whole approach Is to stay close to my kid.  I try to be accepting, and outwardly I am, but inwardly I feel judgmental.  I find myself saying things in my head  (PLEASE don't judge, these are all in my head and not what I express to them) like:

""OMG they are SO acting like teenage girls!!!"" ""She (they, but my head says she) is NOT a guy..she will realize It later"" ""She Is just doing this because she is rejecting her body, she had her period at 9 and had NO ONE to relate to"" ""I will just accept them, they can't really put a permanent label on themselves right now and they may change before they are an adult, or they may not, and that's ok too"".  

I feel guilty for my thoughts, but I am working on my inner self and I know this judgment comes from my past.  I always ALWAYS make sure I make my child feel loved and accepted but man it is HARD.  

What I am looking for here is how do I approach this other parent? I am nervous that the kids are telling the truth and she may actually be super judgmental and there may be no right thing I can say to her.  I am hoping to open her mind somehow, but also feel low key guilty that my mind (inner thoughts) are NOT open enough.  I also feel like this may make me more relatable to her, but I think you guys can provide me with some amazing Insight and things I can share to help this parent come to terms with this (and help this child, who is struggling the way we ALL struggled with our parents at this age).  I want to be an advocate for the kids, how do I NOT screw things up???

369,Historical-Plate551,1694498339.0,"Please give me questions to help me understand my gender

I [22] have been having a prolonged gender crisis since last October (thanks Gerard Way) but because of the transphobic and kinda toxic environment I grew up in I don’t feel like I can trust myself. 
I’m here asking for some prompts, questions, thought exercises, visualizations ect to do to document my feelings about my identiy so I can come to know myself better and create a “Cis with trauma vs Trans man” scoreboard a la the “You Suck” board from stranger things. 
They can be super basic “who did you relate to din Disney movies? (Mulan,Hercules,Snow White and Cinderella) questions or super intricate vision board projects. Anything that helped you or you think could help me. 
I’ve put a rambling reflection on my gender history below for those curious. It’s not edited or reread apologies( I’m exhausted i may edit it later. ) 






 Long history;
Growing up and even now I was made to second guess my mental (memory,beliefs,desires) and,physical (pain,hunger,illness) experiences. I was repeatedly told I was a hypochondriac when I was right about being sick or injured. I was told I was too sensitive and that I was unable to think for myself, when I was just a kid reacting to abuse and expressing different opinions. (Im also neurodivergent so that contributed to the criticism) So now as an adult I’m an indecisive wreck that can’t make choices and has no sense of self. I’m working with a therapist to learn how to trust myself and solidify my identity as a person, because atm I’m basically Ella Enchanted and just obey because that’s all I’ve known.

My gender identity has (if I can trust some memories) been something I struggled with alot in my adolescence primarily around puberty, although I did dislike being seen as a “girly girl” and wanted to be a tomboy as a small child. However that can be chalked up to the misogyny and intense emphasis on being athletic that existed in my early years. I was very “floaty” and “like a little fairy” as a young child always picking flowers, reading, drawing or playing pretend. I was also the runt of the neighborhood something I greatly resented.I was too skinny for most pants, couldn’t keep up with sports and was very anxious with no pain tolerance or balance. I was a girl though. I liked dolls and being a princess. I loved dresses and dreamed of being beautiful and being a woman. 
 Eventually due to a traumatic loss in the family and extreme bullying at school and home I became very jaded and loathed everything feminine and soft especially as it related to me. I wanted to be seen as big and scary so people would leave me alone and not relize I was weak and vulnerable. I was forced into martial arts and after my abusive sister left it I found confidence there as well as in the screamo,emo,rockand alt pop music i listened to. 
It was at this time I really began to desire androgyny. But I still saw myself as a girl. I was happy that I was developing sexually and wanted to look like lots of arguably feminine figures, MARINA and Lizzy Hale being two of the most prominent. As well as all the emo girls I saw on Pinterest (my only social media at the time). At the same time I loathed my breasts, fantasized about pretending to be a man and eventually got my hair cut as short as possible without my hairdresser using clippers. I found crossplay (cosplaying the opposite sex) and began experimenting dressing as the boys and men I saw myself in. Feeling euphoric when I hollowed out my cheeks and defined my already sharp jaw. (Something I miss and hope to regain with fat loss). I existed and to a certain extent exist in this weird limbo between man and woman.
 I deeply crave femininity to be soft and beautiful with long flowing curls. Soft curves & long elegant limbs wrapped in a light cotton lawn. To be sharply sexy a femme fatale. Plastic and perky like a Barbie or Bratz doll. To be subversive and butch. I want to grow to fill the shoes of the women in my family I admire. 
At the same time I crave masculinity. To be perceived as a man by my peers. I want the blunt squared off beauty of the men in greaser flicks or in characters like Billy Hargrove. Tough gritty but prideful in appearance. I want to be soft sweaters and polos the kind of man that makes people feel safe and nurtured.  I want people to see me wear nail polish and be shocked. I want to be pretty in the way a man can be. I want to wear a suit and tie but not in the way a woman might or well perhaps sometimes like that but not always. I want to be my father’s son even though I’d be the greatest disappointment seeing as I have to mechanical or athletic ability but at least then I wouldn’t have to be called a name he loves and I’ve always loathed.

I’m constantly riding a pendulum from one end to the other often spending months or years at one end save for a few occasions. 

I have photos from when I cut my hair and it fills me with joy to see that little boy grow up sometimes more so than the little girl in the rest who sometimes feels fake and like an act a poor impression of a girl. 

Like I went to my grandfather’s funeral recently and wore a beautiful black dress with makeup and did my hair. I couldn’t look away, I liked it but I couldn’t tell if I liked being the pretty girl in the mirror or just looking at her. Plus the sick relief of not having to worry about disappointing my grandfather when I question my faith and gender was unnerving. It was like I buried part of the person I built for other people like I was able to bury part of who “given name” is and make room for me. 

Kind of Nsfw but seeing bottom growth makes me so jealous. I want that! I want a penis and vagina. I used a toy as a “prosthetic” for some “me time” and it was upsetting afterwards that it wasn’t really mine.

Also I’m consistently frustrated that I can’t walk around shirtless. Every day I become angrier and angrier about it. And it’s been a lifelong thing. I like my boobs (mostly :/) but why can’t they be seen like pecks why can’t I be shirtless without being seen as violating someone or a slut.

First of all, I don’t have any problem with or wouldn’t ever deny anyone of identifying as whatever they want to be - you do you! But, I can’t help but think that creating lots of different genders is contradictory to the freedom it preaches.

Many different countries have different expectations on men and women, as well as religions, cultures, etc. So gender identities can never be set in stone. And if there is not a clear definition for each, how can one feel like their gender doesn’t fit? 

I get it if you feel like you don’t want the body or genitalia you currently have, but that is sex, not gender.

If you are a boy who wants to wear skirts, why not just be a boy who likes to wear skirts? Fuck what anyone else thinks. The idea that some things are ‘feminine’ or ‘masculine’ is the result of centuries of conditioning, and it continues to harm and oppress females, including those who identify as or who have transitioned to female to this day. It also harms males: ‘toxic masculinity’. So why can’t we fight to get rid of it all? 

I feel like calling yourself gender non-binary is contradictory in itself, because how is gender a binary if it has no clear definition on either end? 

Like I said, no hate, it just doesn’t make sense to me.

I (15) don’t know what my gender identity is (whether i’m cis or not). 

I think that i’m a woman (at least that’s how i am currently be perceived), however, i want to be acknowledged as a guy.

 i’d want people to look at me when i’m walking down the street and think that i’m a guy (or even question if i’m a guy or girl). i wanna dress like a guy, get a “guy” haircut, i want to be reffered to as he/him i want to be called a boy. i would genuinely get the surgey (top & bottom when i’m older ofc) out of my desire to be a guy. it’s not anything that makes me feel this way (i don’t feel this way because of misogyny or anything like that) but it’s genuinely how i want to express myself. i know that being masculine /stud (for context i’m afab who only likes women)  wouldnt be good enough for me.

I don’t consider myself male or nonbinary- it’s clear to me that I’m female. Though I break a lot of gender norms - I HATE makeup. I dont style my hair or nails. Sometimes for special occasions I’ll get done up and like how I look but I hate the process. Currently I’m having breakdowns over bras. I mostly stopped wearing them and hate knowing that to look presentable in some contexts I have to wear one and want to cry. It’s stupid. Bras are stupid and they suck. 
I hate having female breasts. I dream of being able to enjoy time outside without covering up. I hate the expectations that are placed on women. And while I support trans women, a lot of the language is really upsetting to me surrounding what is considered “transitioning” to present as “female” because it’s mostly things I’m not or don’t do or hate having to do. (***I am aware this is a ME issue and love seeing happy trans women!).

I hate the female experience of this world - but I don’t feel like anything but a woman, I think? I hated pregnancy. I hate menstruation. I’ve begged for over a decade for a hysterectomy but settled for an IUD -insertion was literal torture. 

I think the way men get to enjoy this world for the most part is so much better and I want that and get viscerally jealous of my husband and other male family and friends.

375,Catch-Ok,1693971111.0,"I'm 27 (M). I see gender and sex as distinct. I see myself as male, but I feel generally indifferent to gender on the whole, excluding how it negatively affects my ability to express myself freely. For example: I enjoy wearing skirts; further, I am a nudist. Neither of those things are safe/legal where I am now. 

I want to state an opinion I have on sexual chatacteristics. I think there is a most feminine and most masculine form. I don't think either is attainable, and I think all humans are within a spectrum of expression regarding these characteristics. I don't know how to qualify these forms, either; i.e., I don't know what the most masculine penis or most feminine brain shape, etc., would look like. 

Further I want to state an opinion I have on gendered characteristics. I don't think there's any sort of objective gender expression. Someone acting in a way society has deemed ""masculine"" by say chewing tobacco and shooting guns does not seem like any sort of real qualification. That's the whole thing; gender, to me, seems like a hollow, made-up social construct without much weight to it. 

I have nothing against people choosing to identify with gender as a construct. I choose to identify with plenty of made-up things as well.

The TL;DR is I have no idea how to label myself regarding gender! 

The only sex-related dysphoria I've ever had is over being wombless. Since I reached puberty, I have always wanted to be able to get pregnant and carry a child to term and give birth. I don't care about being female or having other reproductive organs or a different appearance or anything. I would not mind periods, I would happily accept that pain and embrace that cycle for the ability to birth my progeny.

I wanted to share a family tree model that I created in hopes of creating a more standardized gender-inclusive family tree, tying all the titles together with an easy-to-remember “kin” theme. More details on the philosophy/intent of this family tree can be found in the Notes section, but as a brief introduction, I feel like the current conversation and efforts on gender-inclusive titles are very fragmented and individualized to a degree that leaves much uncertainty when it comes to actually applying it in everyday life; even those who are trying to adopt more inclusive terms are struggling or uncertain. It is not my intent to offend or negate any attempts that have already been made, I am just trying to tie it all together and to fill a niche in the gender-inclusivity conversation that I personally believe has not yet been filled, but seems much needed.

Hoping to generate some constructive conversation on this topic, and this family tree model can absolutely be modified or upgraded (with room for on-going change already built into this existing model), but the intent is to keep the spirit of having a base model (or “starting point”) that is accessible to mainstream conversation (not just those well-versed on gender issues).

Thanks everyone for any thoughts/input.

\---------------------

See: ""Kin"" Family Tree graphic

Some clarifying commentary on the ""Kin"" Family Tree graphic is provided regarding Terms as well as general Notes, below.

Terms:

·  <3 (heart icon): This is “You” on the family tree. 

·  Kindles: Means light, torch, inspiration. This word seems appropriate to the role of any caregiver (biological or otherwise) while preserving the base word “kin”. Kindlers could also be used. Other commonly used inclusive terms were also provided in this section (e.g. grown-up, guardian, caregiver, adult, parent, etc.).

o  For those seeking a title that distinguishes the maternal or paternal role (whether that is biological or as a primary role or both), a starting place might be the terms Ma and Pa. These sounds take into consideration early childhood language development, which it is speculated that the reason names for “mama” and “papa” are similar across the world is because these are some of the first sounds a baby learns. It also leaves flexibility for both traditional and progressive interpretations (e.g. “Ma” can simply stand for “maternity” as in the period of pregnancy and birthing, or it can mean anything or everything associated with mothers and/or maternity. Similarly, “Pa” can simply stand for “paternity” as in paternal origin, or it can mean anything or everything associated with fathers and/or paternity.) Anyone seeking to individualize their parental title (for any reason, whether it be related to gender-identity or cultural or familial or personal or relational or any other reasons) is of course still encouraged to do so. If it’s helpful, please consider using other early-development sounds when creating or selecting a title. The first sounds to develop tend to include: m p b h w n. (So, as one example, someone who identifies as a Birthing Parent could go by Bibi, or a Non-binary parent might go by Nini.) That being said, some have found success with titles that use later developing sounds as well, such as Zaza.

·  Sibkin: “Sibling” hardly needed any adjustment, but some abbreviated and kin-based titles were provided for consistency. Other root words for sibling: Sib, Sibbe, Sibja. Sibber is similar to both “brother” and “sister”. 

·  Grandkins: This was chosen to emulate popular terms such as grandpa or grandma. Elderkins also seemed to be a title that needed no further explanation while also being a respectful. Grandparent is also a word in current usage that is already gender-neutral.

·  Kinne: Finding terms to categorize the siblings of one’s parents was the most difficult nail down, since the word that references both “aunts and uncles” is avunculus, which can be kind of a mouthful and also didn’t fit the “kin” model. (Auncle has also been proposed as a way to merge “aunts and uncles”, although when said out loud, this may be difficult to distinguish from Uncle.) Given that honorifics for aunts and uncles are more loosely used (often referring to friends or family who aren’t strictly the siblings of one’s parents), I thought it might be a good candidate for a more broad use of the word “kin.” Searching through the history of the word “kin,” “Kinne” stood out. Easy to say (could be pronounced “Kin-nee”), and some phonetic similarities with both auntie and uncle. Kinne also means “to know, to be familiar with,” which seems relevant to the role. Other root words such as Kuni, Kunne, Kunni, Kyn, Kunja are also some close fits. Kinkin (simply repeating the sound twice) could use serve as a title/honorific (and is also included in the friends and family section).

·  Neokin: Neo means new or young (which is often the connotation of a nephew or niece relative to an individual); it also sounds similar to both nephew and niece. Nibling has also been proposed as a gender neutral title in this category; to fit the “kin” model, Nibkins could also be used.

·  Kinders: Children or Kids hardly needed any adjustment, but some kin-based titles were provided for consistency, such as Kinders or Kindlings.

·  Grandkinders: Grandchildren or Grandkids hardly needed any adjustment, but some kin-based titles (Grandkinders, Grandkindlings) were provided for consistency.

·  Kikin – This is being introduced as a possible substitute for using “auntie” or “uncle” for friends and framily (framily meaning “A group of friends who are close like a family”). Kikin or Kiki is short for “Kith and Kin” (which means “friends and family”). It should be noted that “Kiki” may have certain connotations in the LGBTQI+ community, and so Ki-kin or Kin-kin may be preferred for those wishing to avoid that connotation.

·  Kindreds: i.e. Kindred spirits. Could be used to denote a friend or family member whose interests or attitudes are similar to one's own.

·  Fur-kinders: Furfamily and furchildren hardly needed any adjustment, but wanted to make sure our furfriends were included in this kin/family tree!

·  -Kin or -Kins can also be attached as an honorific suffix to end of names, e.g. Maria-kin, David-kins, Joey-kins, Sasha-kin. Many people in the US are already familiar with the use of honorific suffixes in languages such as Japan, e.g. chan, san, etc. -Kin or -Kins can simply denote family. 

·  As with any family or culture, individual preferences/adjustments for individual titles/honorifics should be considered.

&#x200B;

Notes:

·  This kin/family tree model is meant to support a more unified rather than divided conversation as the US moves forward towards gender-inclusivity. Right now, the choice seems to be between either standardized but non-inclusive language (e.g. aunt, uncle, brother, sister, etc.) or inclusive language that is unstandardized/individualistic to a degree that is not accessible to mainstream conversation (e.g. is it Auncle or Pibling or Unty or…? Is this my Nephiece or Niecew?). This model is intended to provide some standardized starting points for American English that can than be personalized on an individual or relational basis (something that should be familiar for even more traditional households, e.g. “Grandmother” is standardized but “Grandma” or “Nana” or “Abuela” is personalized). 

·  These terms are meant be gender *fully inclusive*, meaning that they are not just intended for “gender-queer” or “non-binary” persons, but are intended to refer to people of any genders (or lack thereof). These terms are meant to be inclusive, non-assumptive, and non-offensive.  For example, all children of your sibling(s) regardless of individual gender-identity could be referred to as “neokins” (which is easier and more inclusive than saying “nephews and nieces” and definitely easier than saying “nephews and nieces and any other preferred titles”), in the same manner that it is already acceptable to refer to all children of your children as “grandkids” (regardless of their individual gender identity). Likewise, a binary-identifying person (e.g. male- or female-identifying) can also introduce themselves as, for example, Kinne (instead of Aunt or Uncle); as could a non-binary person, or any other person. These terms are for everyone.

·  Having fully inclusive terms may be especially helpful for family members who may still be exploring gender identity and are not ready for (or interested in) committing to a gender-typed label or identity, or to protect the privacy of people who may not be interested in going public with their personal identity, or for large families or other types of communities or gatherings where not everyone’s specific gender identity or preferred titles are known or easily remembered, or where referring to large groups of people is needed.

·  These terms can also be used interchangeably with existing or more traditional titles (similar to how a Filipino-American might call their aunt both “Auntie” and “Tiya”). Someone could, for example, respond to both “Uncle” and “Kinne.”

·  The basic philosophy of this family tree model was to look for a word that means “family” or “kin” (or tribe or clan or other similar words/concepts) to act as a common link between all relative titles/honorifics. Specific titles/honorifics were pulled primarily from either synonyms or history/etymology of existing US-English words, with preference given to any word that sounded similar to currently used terms (e.g. cuzkin, sibkin, neokin, etc.) or were relatively self-evident in their meaning (e.g. elderkin). Early childhood language development was also taken into consideration for primary caregivers (see notes under “Kindles”). The language of this family tree model is based on US-English, but if anyone is looking to apply to their own language/culture, a similar model may be relevant. (Note: “Clan” appears in a lot of European / Latin-based alphabets.)

·  As another note, terms that blended existing binary terms (e.g. merging nephew and niece to form Nephiece or Niecew; merging aunt and uncle to form Auncle) were also avoided in favor of terms without any obvious reference to binary language or ideology, other than perhaps some phonetic similarities (e.g. Kinne is phonetically similar to both Auntie and Uncle; Neokins is phonetically similar to both Nephews and Nieces) to help support a sense of familiarity/accessibility of these modern terms for those accustomed to more traditional terms. This model seeks to “start over” with inclusive terms (thus the preference for historical/etymological terms) rather than “fixing” the ways in which certain languages evolved to fit a non-inclusive binary ideology.

·  Although other gender-inclusive terms have been proposed, such as niblings for nieces/nephews and piblings for uncles/aunts, none have (to my knowledge) provided an overall model of terms that were easily unified (in this case, by the term “kin”) across all different familial roles/titles. An advantage of “kin” is that it also doesn’t have connotations related to other existing titles. For example, pibling and nibling sounds like “sibling”, whereas kin and simply means (and connotes) “family” or “relative”. “Kin” is also short and easy to say and works well as both an honorific title and honorific suffix. Regardless, this model leaves room for any and all individualized titles (whether that is Auntie or Uncle or Tio or Titi or Pibling or Auncle or Tante or Funcle or Zia or any other title based on personal or cultural or familial or other preference); it simply acknowledges that the individualized titles can take some time and effort to learn and to provide a fully inclusive base model as a starting point.

·  Users of this model are not obligated or even necessarily encouraged to use the “kin” honorific for all the roles.  It’s just used across all roles for consistency, but if you or your family are more comfortable using the more familiar “cousin” rather than “cuzkin”, then any inclusive term will do. Some of these roles are already filled with predominantly-used gender-inclusive terms, such as cousins, kids, grandkids, and are not in need of a different term (i.e. these niches are already filled); however, “kin” terms are provided for consistency.

·  This model is not meant to be an be-all-end-all, but rather provide some common ground for mainstream conversation. For those who are seeking to move forward with more unifying language across certain traditional and progressive ideologies, a lot of these words are both deeply rooted in tradition (traditional/historical language and etymology) while also being modern in its usage/application. 

·  Thank you to those who have considered this model or any other solutions towards creating an inclusive society. It is not (and probably could not) be a “perfect” model, but the hope is for it to be a functional and accessible model.

I am a cis woman using she/her pronouns and I'm...kinda new to understanding gender and everything so please bear with me ❤️
Recently I've been questioning myself about my gender and I'm wondering whether anyone knows how this works so I can understand my feelings.

So for the last few years I was figuring out my sexual attraction. At first it was just guys but I now identify as bisexual. The problem is that I sort of have an attraction to guys in a 'gay way' and an attraction to girls in a 'straight way'. I also have had a tendency to have crushes on very feminine and openly gay dudes. I don't really know why but when I heard that a guy I liked came out as gay, I kind of got an excited feeling like 'yes I have a chance!' but then I realized...oop I'm female :/
So that may have just been the 'scientifically proven attraction girls have to gay men' but THERE'S MORE.

For the last month ish I've been contouring my face to look more masculine from tuts I found on pinterest or whatever and i am looking into getting my hair cut down short (overall a more masculine presentation). I naturally have a small chest but I've also been looking at clothes which make you look less feminine etc.

There's one big problem though.
I don't really like the sound of he/him pronouns? Imagining myself using them just sounds really foreign as well as using they/them. But I still kind of feel out of place with as 'she'. I tried looking at neo pronouns but that didn't really fit either :(

There are other factors which I won't bore you with but I'm overall just wondering if anyone has experienced something similar to me or has any advice. Thanks!",4,0,gender

as i grew older, i learned to enjoy my feminine side more and i genuinley love being a woman but when i f.ex. wear v masculine looking clothes, but have a v feminine hair do and makeup, it gives me great comfort and joy.

however, she/her are the only pronouns i think rlly fit, but my nickname i introduce myself with is traditionally a male name (nico instead of nicole; i cringe a lot when ppl call me nicole bc it makes me feel feminine in a bad way?), i also realized any traditionally masucline name would make me v comfy, but i still want to be femme presenting, to purposfully feel that contrast.


i feel silly bc i feel like those things r really minor but smtms i rlly wonder. i also keep seeing femme presenting people wear make-up moustaches and it fills me with such an undescribable feeling of intrigue and i feel so connected to it? i also remember once i had to dress up as a man for a themed photo, along with other girls who also dressed as men and i wanted to look as masucline as possible, put immense effort into it and if u compare me to the other girls on the photo, i v v v much leaned into the masculine and felt super happy when i saw it and people pointed out to me how masculine i looked.

395,tonybaloney24k,1692751185.0,"we keep creating circular arguments about dismantling construct, by creating more construct. we claim that the male|female binary is mostly a social system that isn’t necessarily an objective way of looking at what gender is. This is true I 100% agree but people create more construct (the multiple genders) as a way of ‘tearing down gender roles’ but this only creates more genders for people to socially conform to just like male|female. a true progressive take imo is a ‘Gender absent society’ where gender isn’t an idea which is even thought about or acknowledged when interacting with people, even if somebody’s sex is considered, their gender identity is even thought about as a factor in that person since it’s a social system and hypothetically doesn’t have to exist in a given society.  creating more gender identities just eventually becomes gender norms through time and is the exact opposite choice when eliminating gender a social construct The idea of a post gender society is too hard of a concept to grasp even for those who vouch for the idea. it just encourages more tribalism and division among people as we create more ways to differentiate one another. creating more gender construct to replace the current one is the answer, it’s a circular solution to a real problem.  

- it should be considered that the crawl to a gender absent society has been   progressing slowly. key movements in feminism such as the right to vote and other ways in which women have been growing or gained more agency and equity in society slowly dissolves certain aspects of seeing each other as different. but we are still far from a gender absent society, progress has slowly been made. feminism could be seen as a way to eventually progress in a gender absent society. mostly from identifying the inherent make believe of gender identity and eventually gender as a whole. creating or discovering more genders is the exact opposite.

- “The intention behind acknowledging and embracing these identities is to provide inclusivity and representation for individuals who do not fit within traditional gender norms. The goal is not to perpetuate the construct of gender but rather to provide visibility and respect for the lived experiences of marginalized gender identities.” it doesn’t matter what the intention is, intention doesn’t mean that the issues that i proposed before don’t arise from it. labeling or celebrating different gender identities just creates more to be attached to and leads to tribalism and eventually hierarchy and gender roles among those new and accepted identities",4,0,gender

I know I'm not a big fan of they/them pronouns (for myself of course) but the idea of being refered to as male pronouns makes me feel... Different? 

I've always identified strongly with male characters (however, they could just be better written than the women) and when I dress up as a character it's always a male. I love being called 'sir' and I've always joked about becoming a doctor because 'Doctor' sounds so much better than 'Miss' or 'Mrs'. I've recently cut my hair shorter and I keep sort of hoping I'll be perceived as more male? I'm comfortable with dressing in a more feminine way. 

I keep wondering if She/He pronouns are right for me or if I'm mistaking my feeling towards make pronouns as something else?? 

It would be nice to have some outsider perspective on this, thinking about it too much hurts your brain",6,0,gender
397,jinn_mori,1692493779.0,"I'm doing an essay to help get a friend out of the transphobe hole as he said that he considers reliable information to be 'By if it's able to be proven with solid evidence and solid reasoning. Not just one piece of evidence but multiple pieces confirming that said info is true.' and one of his arguments is that gender and sex are terms used interchangeably. However, there has been a shift in the use of these words over time.

What I'm wanting to know is when the shift from using sex and gender interchangeably started along with why they were used interchangeably in the first place. Note, I am American and I am looking at this in the context of American culture.

If possible, please link me the sources where you got this information from. Thanks!",5,0,gender
398,KayfoxxAsksForAdvice,1692507822.0,"I'm originally female, but I've come to realize that every once in a while I get super uncomfy with my feminine assets and I often think about if I was a male and what it would be like. I've come to a realization that I like the idea of it. my birth was complicated and I've been told that if I was a guy I would have had no chance at surviving. Because of this I'm very weary of the topic itself. Don't get me wrong I often do enjoy dresses and makeup and princesses and other things rendered ""girly"". But I also feel more comfortable with more masculine things that are rendered as ""boyish"". It's almost like a back and forth thing but sometimes comfortability with one will last longer than the other. Does anyone know what this means, and do you have advice for sneaking it till I can get away from my family members that are deadly sensitive about the topic?",1,0,gender
